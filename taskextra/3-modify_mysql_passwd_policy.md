The error `ERROR 1819 (HY000)` occurs when the password provided does not meet the password policy requirements set in the MySQL server. These requirements are controlled by the MySQL `validate_password` plugin.

To resolve this issue, you can either create a password that meets the current policy requirements or modify the password policy settings. Here are the steps for both approaches:

### Approach 1: Create a Password That Meets the Current Policy Requirements

The default password policy typically requires the password to be:

1. At least 8 characters long.
2. Contain at least one uppercase letter, one lowercase letter, one digit, and one special character.

### Example of a Strong Password
```
MyStr0ng!Passw0rd
```

### Approach 2: Modify the Password Policy Settings

If you prefer to set a simpler password, you can change the password policy settings. Hereâ€™s how you can do it:

1. **Connect to the MySQL Server:**
   ```sh
   mysql -u root -p
   ```

2. **Check Current Password Policy Settings:**
   ```sql
   SHOW VARIABLES LIKE 'validate_password%';
   ```

3. **Modify the Password Policy Settings:**
   You can adjust the password policy level or change specific parameters.

   - **Change the Password Policy Level:**
     ```sql
     SET GLOBAL validate_password.policy = LOW;
     ```

     The available levels are:
     - `LOW`: Only checks the length.
     - `MEDIUM`: Checks length, mixed case, number, and special character.
     - `STRONG`: Checks all previous criteria and dictionary file.

   - **Adjust Specific Parameters:**
     ```sql
     SET GLOBAL validate_password.length = 6;  -- Minimum password length
     SET GLOBAL validate_password.mixed_case_count = 0;  -- Minimum number of uppercase and lowercase characters
     SET GLOBAL validate_password.number_count = 0;  -- Minimum number of numeric characters
     SET GLOBAL validate_password.special_char_count = 0;  -- Minimum number of special characters
     ```

4. **Set the Password:**
   After modifying the policy, set the password again with the new policy in effect.

### Example of Changing Password
```sql
ALTER USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';
```

By following these steps, you can either create a password that satisfies the current policy or modify the policy to accept a simpler password.
