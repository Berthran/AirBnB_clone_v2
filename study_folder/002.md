# How to map a Python Class to a MySQL Table
## What does the `create_engine()` method do

When you run the `create_engine` command in SQLAlchemy with a MySQL dialect and connection string like `mysql+mysqlconnector://dan1234:Dan1234###@localhost/hbtn_0e_0_usa`, several things happen:

1. **Engine Creation:** SQLAlchemy creates a database engine object (`Engine`) that represents the interface to the database. This engine manages connections to the MySQL server and executes SQL statements.

2. **Connection Establishment:** The engine establishes a connection to the MySQL server running on `localhost` (or the IP address specified) using the credentials provided:
   - **Username:** `dan1234`
   - **Password:** `Dan1234###`
   - **Database:** `hbtn_0e_0_usa`

   These credentials (`dan1234` as the username, `Dan1234###` as the password) are used to authenticate and gain access to the specified database (`hbtn_0e_0_usa`).

3. **URL Parsing:** The connection URL (`'mysql+mysqlconnector://dan1234:Dan1234###@localhost/hbtn_0e_0_usa'`) is parsed by SQLAlchemy to determine which dialect (`mysql`) and which DBAPI (in this case, `mysqlconnector`) to use for communication with the MySQL server.

4. **Pool Configuration:** SQLAlchemy may also configure a connection pool by default, which manages and reuses database connections, optimizing performance for multiple queries.

In summary, the `create_engine` function in SQLAlchemy sets up an engine object that connects to your MySQL database using the provided credentials and establishes a connection to the specified database. This engine is then used throughout your application to execute SQL queries and interact with the MySQL database.


## The purpose of the `sessionmaker`
In SQLAlchemy, the process of connecting to the MySQL server and interacting with it through ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) involves several steps, and the `Session` object plays a crucial role in managing these interactions.

Here's how it works:

1. **Engine Creation:**
   - You create a SQLAlchemy `engine` object using `create_engine('mysql+mysqlconnector://username:password@localhost/db_name')`. This `engine` object represents the interface to the MySQL database server.

2. **Session Factory Creation:**
   - You create a `Session` factory using `sessionmaker(bind=engine)`. This `Session` factory is not a connection itself but a blueprint for creating `Session` objects.

3. **Session Object Creation (Connection Establishment):**
   - When you call `Session()` (or `session = Session()`), SQLAlchemy establishes a connection to the MySQL server using the `engine` you provided. This connection is not established until you actually instantiate a `Session` object.

4. **Interaction with Database:**
   - Once you have a `Session` object (`session`), you can use it to interact with the database. This includes querying, adding, updating, and deleting records using SQLAlchemy's ORM features.

Therefore, the actual connection to the MySQL server occurs when you instantiate a `Session` object (`Session()` or `session = Session()`). This `Session` object manages the connection and transactions with the MySQL server for all subsequent database operations you perform within that session.

In summary, the `Session` object in SQLAlchemy is responsible for connecting to the MySQL server when instantiated, and it maintains that connection for the duration of its lifespan, handling all database interactions via SQLAlchemy's ORM capabilities.
